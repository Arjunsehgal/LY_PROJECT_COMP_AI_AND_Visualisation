# BACKGROUND :                                                                                                                                                                     
Autonomous vehicles are automobiles that can move without any intervention by detecting the road, traffic flow and surrounding objects with the help of the control system they have. These vehicles can detect objects around them by using technologies and techniques such as RADAR, LIDAR, GPS, Odometry, Computer Vision. The autopilot drive of autonomous vehicles starts briefly with the ultrasonic sensors on its wheels, detecting the positions of vehicles that are braking or parked, and data from a wide range of sensors are analysed with a central computer system. This event can only be described as a beginning. As the computer technologies are more accessible and cheaper the future of driverless cars becomes more achievable. Though still in its infancy, self-driving technology is becoming increasingly common and could radically transform our transportation system (and by extension, our economy and society).

The automotive industry is experiencing a paradigm shift from conventional, human-driven vehicles into self-driving, artificial intelligence-powered vehicles. Self-driving vehicles offer a safe, efficient, and cost-effective solution that will dramatically redefine the future of human mobility. Self-driving cars have rapidly become one of the most transformative technologies to emerge. Fuelled, by Deep Learning algorithms, they are continuously driving our society forward and creating new opportunities in the mobility sector.

# 1.1	Scope
          Our system will include:                                                                                                                                          
               •	Lane detecting and following
               •	Object recognition                                                                                                                                   
               •	Stop Sign Detection                                                                                                                          
               •	Traffic Signs Detection

# 1.2	Product Objective

•	Road safety has been an issue for as long as cars have been in existence. Over 1.3 million people die of road accidents every year across the globe, most of which are preventable. 

•	Ever-rising Road traffic has led to an exponential increase in commute time. This has a direct impact not only on people's productivity but also on the environment.

•	Recent developments in machine learning and artificial intelligence along with the ever-increasing performance of modern-day computers have enabled the use of these technologies in developing self-driving cars. 

These cars have several advantages, as described below:

               1. Better road safety: Machines are not prone to human-error and distractions, leading to swift and appropriate responses in real-time road conditions.

               2. Increased productivity: Reduced commute times mean more time can be spent on what matters more.

               3. Reduced expenditure: Reduction in accidents will directly lead to reduced expenditure on damages.

               4. Environment-friendly: Efficient driving styles of the self-driving car will lead to lower emissions.

               5. Better traffic discipline: Better law enforcement can be achieved and traffic can be managed by capping speed in various regions.

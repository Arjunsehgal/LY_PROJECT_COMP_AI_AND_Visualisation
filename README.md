BACKGROUND :
Autonomous vehicles are automobiles that can move without any intervention by detecting the road, traffic flow and surrounding objects with the help of the control system they have. These vehicles can detect objects around them by using technologies and techniques such as RADAR, LIDAR, GPS, Odometry, Computer Vision. The autopilot drive of autonomous vehicles starts briefly with the ultrasonic sensors on its wheels, detecting the positions of vehicles that are braking or parked, and data from a wide range of sensors are analysed with a central computer system. This event can only be described as a beginning. As the computer technologies are more accessible and cheaper the future of driverless cars becomes more achievable. Though still in its infancy, self-driving technology is becoming increasingly common and could radically transform our transportation system (and by extension, our economy and society).

The automotive industry is experiencing a paradigm shift from conventional, human-driven vehicles into self-driving, artificial intelligence-powered vehicles. Self-driving vehicles offer a safe, efficient, and cost-effective solution that will dramatically redefine the future of human mobility. Self-driving cars have rapidly become one of the most transformative technologies to emerge. Fuelled, by Deep Learning algorithms, they are continuously driving our society forward and creating new opportunities in the mobility sector.
